BOSS Webhook launcher for bitbucket and github.

Web Services : boss-launcher-webhook rpm
========================================

The web application is django-based. It provides both an admin UI and
a destination for post events from git webservices such as github,
bitbucket and others.

It is monitored by supervisor and controlled by skynet

Typically it will need nginx installing and presents an interface on
/webhook/ for POST requests and on /webhook/admin for administration.


Setup
-----
Go through the settings below.

When setting up you must create an admin user and login as that user
to make a 'Build service' entry before users can add any hooks.

Config files
------------

/etc/supervisor/conf.d/webhook.conf
 Controls the fastcgi detailed setup

/etc/skynet/webhook.conf
 Controls the webui setup (eg LDAP)
 Needs at least the secret_key setting
 Note that db_name is a path for sqlite3. so /var/lib/webhook/webhook
 may be suitable

/etc/skynet/skynet.conf
 Basic skynet setup - should points to the right boss instance

/etc/supervisor/conf.d/delete_webhook.conf
 The delete_webhook process

Install/ Setup
==============

LDAP
----
For ldap support:
 zypper in python-django-auth-ldap python-ldap

Supervisor
----------
supervisord *doesn't actually look* in supervisor/conf.d/ by default

cat <<EOF >> /etc/supervisord.conf
[include]
files = /etc/supervisor/conf.d/*.conf
EOF
supervisorctl reload

Logs
----
/var/log/messages
/var/log/supervisor/*
/var/log/supervisord/*
/var/log/nginx/*

tail -f /var/log/messages /var/log/supervisor/* /var/log/supervisord/* /var/log/nginx/* &

django
------

django settings.py are found here but should not be needed:
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/webhook_launcher/settings.py

Put this secret key in /etc/skynet/webhook.conf
 django-admin generate_secret_key --settings=webhook_launcher.settings

You may need to set these vars before runnyin syncdb
  LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
  LANG=en_US.UTF-8

django-admin syncdb --settings=webhook_launcher.settings
yes, make admin

Prepare the static
django-admin collectstatic --settings=webhook_launcher.settings

nginx
-----
Needs line in http section:
http {
   server_names_hash_bucket_size 128;
}
Also needs the default server {} on port 80 removing

Setup (use your own server_name)

mkdir /etc/nginx/vhosts.d/
cat <<'EOF' > /etc/nginx/vhosts.d/webhook.conf
upstream webhook {
  server 127.0.0.1:9300;
}

server {
   listen 80;
   access_log  /var/log/nginx/webhook.log;

   server_name webhook.example.com;

   location /webhook/site_media {
       root   /var/www/;
   }

   location /webhook {
       include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
       fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_NAME "";
       fastcgi_pass  webhook;
   }

   # Redirect / to the admin UI
   location / {
       rewrite_log on;
       rewrite  ^/$  /webhook/admin/ permanent;
   }
 }
EOF


boss participants
-----------------

delete_webhook lets any boss process delete any webhooks for a prj/pkg
pair.

The participant is installed and setup with skynet; to complete installation:
  skynet apply
  skynet register delete_webhook


The trigger_service participant should usually be installed with other
OBS participants. Then:

  skynet apply
  skynet register trigger_service
